Node library to create an HLS by repeating the content of an HLS VOD.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-repeat
```

## Usage

The code below shows an example on how an HLS VOD of three seconds can be repeated into a new VOD of 9 seconds.

```
const hlsVod = new HLSRepeatVod('http://testcontent.eyevinn.technology/slates/ottera/playlist.m3u8', 3);
hlsVod.load()
.then(() => {
  const mediaManifest = hlsVod.getMediaManifest(4928000);
  console.log(mediaManifest);
});
```

What this library does can be illustrated by this simplified example below.

Consider the following:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

and with this library we can generate a new VOD by repeating this for example three times. This will result in:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```
